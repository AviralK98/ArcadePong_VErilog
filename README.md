#      INTRODUCTION

The CYCLONE-V PROCESSOR is responsible for performing the tasks that the DE1-SoC board was previously responsible for. This is an excellent option for any design that requires high performance in a low-power, cost-sensitive, single processor-based device, such as a mobile phone or tablet. A mini-project that helped students learn about the fundamentals of FPGA System Design processing and design was shown to them using either an LCD screen or a VGA Display in conjunction with a board. 

The focus of this investigation is on the ping-pong arcade game, which not only shows the retro aesthetic but also actively demonstrates the use of the Quartus Prime as well as the VGA and the LCD screen. The project consists of the ‘qpf’ and ‘qsf’ files along with the ‘.v’ files that will be responsible for the working of the whole program. The game can be interacted with, using the Play station 2 controller codec, as they support the VGA capabilities. The game is supposed to be multiplayer-only and is written using the Verilog language on the Quartus platform. The working and execution for designing the code will be discussed in detail along with the flowchart representation and a conclusion shall be drawn for the same.
